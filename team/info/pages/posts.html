# general soggyposting rules
i follow some basic guidelines to keep the account clean. not sure why i'm documenting this, but hey i'm bored
<br>
## creator
soggyposts should be semi-equally split into two parts:
- by soggy world members 
- by cv (sometimes mat)
<br>
## crediting
all community soggyposts should be credited, regardless of whether it's an {esmbot caption command}{/info/assets/examplecaption.png} or {a work of leonardo da vinci}{/info/assets/examplepeak.mp4
-# greasystovegristle}. 
<br>
there should be a semi-transparent readable watermark hidden somewhere in the image.
-## err, clarification - the watermark doesn't actually have to be semi-transparent, but it's a recommended eye candy.
<br>
!()(/info/assets/watermark.png) [70%, 70%, center]
<br>
the format is: ``(made by evilbeast)``
OR, if unsure about the creator: ``(from evilbeast)``
-# the other one will also be used in exceptional cases, like footage (from blank)

## post time
daily at 1-3am {(EET)}{utc+2} - almost always manual, very rarely scheduling using the web client..
if i missed a day then it's probably fine to catch up at any time
