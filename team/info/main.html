}, the wet cat that people are hyperfixated about.. 
we have a [discord server](https://soggy.cat/discord), which is a decent place to find more details about him, specifically [üìÉÔ∏±faq](https://soggy.cat/faq).
-# we're not related to the owner, and unfortunately no longer have contact with them...
<br>
this account (and the discord server) was initially ran by {[ktg5](https://twitter.com/_ktg5)}{

  **kyle / frametrick** <br> also a programmer, but mainly focuses on streaming and making //BANGER// content on [yt](https://youtube.com/@ktg5/videos) <br> he also runs a pretty popular bot: [@oocnichijou](https://twitter.com/oocnichijou) <br><br> [ktg5.online](https://ktg5.online) <br> ^(he/they)^ <br>

} and his friend [friendlypaths](https://x.com/friendlypaths), but ktg ended up transfering the ownership to {[cv](https://x.com/cvsilly_?mx=1)}{
  **cv / cvsilly / cvgd** <br> a nerd interested in random exploits / bugs and data analysis <br> ^(he/they)^
} ~(me)~ due to {not feeling as attached to the community}{
  _"we've just been inactive a lot more than we'd like to be, thus we've been very **_out of touch_** with the community and haven't been posting much on the account."_

}. both ktg and paths later _left the server_ and {have never posted on ssoggycat since}{
  _"it should be noted I don‚Äôt run the account anymore. guess you could say, the joke got DRY xd"_ <br> [@ktg5](https://x.com/_ktg5/status/1887469930045698552?mx=1)
